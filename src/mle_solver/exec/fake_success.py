"""Fake-success detector.

Two cheap checks that catch the common "script crashed and printed fallback
scores" pattern:

1. Every non-id prediction column is strictly constant (nunique <= 1).
2. The submission is byte-identical to sample_submission.csv.

Near-constant predictions are NOT flagged — on imbalanced classification
they are legitimate. Gap-threshold audits live in the reviewer agent, not here.
